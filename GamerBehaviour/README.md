# My contributions to the task
This assignment focused on analysing player engagement and behaviour in a cybersecurity awareness game called CyberVigilance. The purpose was to investigate how gaming can be used as an educational tool to improve cybersecurity awareness, as games are engaging, cost-effective, and accessible to a wide audience.

Data for the analysis was collected from honours students who played the game, with their results captured in CSV files. The dataset included features such as nickname, defender score, attacker score, time taken, winner, and level. After merging all the data, it was cleaned, transformed, and normalised to address skewness and ensure suitability for machine learning models.

Three models were applied: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Naïve Bayes. SVM was used because it works well with small datasets and non-linear classification. Naïve Bayes was included as a probabilistic model that provides a simple and efficient baseline, although it assumes independence between features. Random Forest was chosen because it is robust, reduces overfitting, handles missing data well, and provides feature importance. An ensemble model was also tested to combine the strengths of multiple classifiers.

Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, ROC curves, and Lazy Predict benchmarking. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy, while SVM and Naïve Bayes also performed well. The results showed that winner outcomes could be predicted reliably from the given features, though the dataset’s simplicity limited deeper behavioural insights.

My contributions included cleaning and transforming the dataset (log, Yeo-Johnson, and square root transformations), conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify skewness and distributions, implementing SVM, Random Forest, and Naïve Bayes models, and evaluating model performance using precision, recall, ROC curves, and confusion matrices. I also interpreted the results to highlight the strengths of Random Forest in this context and discussed ways the game could be improved for stronger player engagement and more meaningful insights.
